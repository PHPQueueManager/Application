# PHP Queue Manager

This application was created to easily create and manage your own job queues. This implementation is based on [PHPQueueManager](https://github.com/PHPQueueManager/PHPQueueManager) library. It aims to abstract away queuing mechanisms and message workers.

_see:_ **[Development Documents](https://github.com/PHPQueueManager/Application/wiki)**

```
composer create-project phpqueuemanager/application
```

## Why should I use it?

- This application provides tremendous flexibility in scaling.
- It can work with different queue mechanisms and different connections at the same time.
- There can be different workers and consumers processing a single queue.
- Advanced error and data management support.
